For password hashing, we use SHA1 (e.g., hash-256 checks more slowly), which the API also uses.

The technology used to submit the actual password is called K-anonymity. It is used by companies like Google, Netflix, Amazon, etc.

In this process, the API takes the first 5 characters of the hashed password and checks it.

If running `python3 checkmypass.py [password]` in the terminal returns 200, then it's good.

The hash algorithm is globally known as IDEMPOTENT.
